Vauquer; “you do what you like.”</p><p>“How did you get back?” inquired Vautrin.</p><p>“I walked,” answered Eugene.</p><p>“For my own part,” remarked the tempter, “I do not care about doing things by halves. If I want to enjoy myself that way, I should prefer to go in my carriage, sit in my own box, and do the thing comfortably. Everything or nothing; that is my motto.”</p><p>“And a good one, too,” commented Mme. Vauquer.</p><p>“Perhaps you will see Mme. de Nucingen to-day,” said Eugene, addressing Goriot in an undertone. “She will welcome you with open arms, I am sure; she would want to ask you for all sorts of little details about me. I have found out that she will do anything in the world to be known by my cousin Mme. de Beauseant; don’t forget to tell her that I love her too well not to think of trying to arrange this.”</p></div> </div>
