Lord! that man can’t have had a stroke; he is as white as curds.”</p><p>“White as curds?” echoed Poiret.</p><p>“And his pulse is steady,” said the widow, laying her hand on his breast.</p><p>“Steady?” said the astonished Poiret.</p><p>“He is all right.”</p><p>“Do you think so?” asked Poiret.</p><p>“Lord! Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. Sylvie has gone for a doctor. I say, Mlle. Michonneau, he is sniffing the ether. Pooh! it is only a spasm. His pulse is good. He is as strong as a Turk. Just look, mademoiselle, what a fur tippet he has on his chest; that is the sort of man to live till he is a hundred. His wig holds on tightly, however. Dear me! it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why he wears a wig. They say that red-haired people are either the worst or the best. Is he one of the good ones, I wonder?”</p></div> </div>
