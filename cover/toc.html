Poiret Was A Sort Of Automaton. He Might Be Seen Any Day Sailing Like A Gray Shadow Along The Walks Of The Jardin Des Plantes, On His Head A Shabby Cap, A Cane With An Old Yellow Ivory Handle In The Tips Of His Thin Fingers; The Outspread Skirts Of His Threadbare Overcoat Failed To Conceal His Meagre Figure; His Breeches Hung Loosely On His Shrunken Limbs; The Thin, Blue-stockinged Legs Trembled Like Those Of A Drunken Man; There Was A Notable Breach Of Continuity Between The Dingy White Waistcoat And Crumpled Shirt Frills And The Cravat Twisted About A Throat Like A Turkey Gobbler’s; Altogether, His Appearance Set People Wondering Whether This Outlandish Ghost Belonged To The Audacious Race Of The Sons Of Japhet Who Flutter About On The Boulevard Italien. What Devouring Kind Of Toil Could Have So Shriveled Him? What Devouring Passions Had Darkened That Bulbous Countenance, Which Would Have Seemed Outrageous As A Caricature? What Had He Been? Well, Perhaps He Had Been Part Of The Machinery Of Justice, A Clerk In The Office To Which The Executioner Sends In His Accounts,—so Much For Providing Black Veils For Parricides, So Much For Sawdust, So Much For Pulleys And Cord For The Knife. Or He Might Have Been A Receiver At The Door Of A Public Slaughter-house, Or A Sub-inspector Of Nuisances. Indeed, The Man Appeared To Have Been One Of The Beasts Of Burden In Our Great Social Mill; One Of Those Parisian Ratons Whom Their Bertrands Do Not Even Know By Sight; A Pivot In The Obscure Machinery That Disposes Of Misery And Things Unclean; One Of Those Men, In Short, At Sight Of Whom We Are Prompted To Remark That, “After All, We Cannot Do Without Them.”</a> <span class="flex">35</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="294">M.
